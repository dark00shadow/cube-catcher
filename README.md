# cube catcher


the .zip is the game 
and the code.txt is the code 

and when you download the .zip it tells you what to do from there
also when you downoad the .zip make sure to take out the forlder inside 

and the cmd will put out the numbers when you get new point and it will show your points 

also you need python (get it via https://www.python.org/downloads/ , since theres now a exe u might not need python now)
